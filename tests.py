# here we are going to create a key value pair to call different tests upon a
# selected index as prompted by command: "test"

# you can use from tests import test_bank

test_bank = {"1": body_test, "2": irregulars}


# body test should reside here

# irregulars should reside here (should look like pyBook pg.377)

# so on so forth
